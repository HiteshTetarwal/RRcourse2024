## Project Overview
This project involves reproducing and enhancing an analysis of house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. Our work includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building various machine learning models to predict house prices. We have translated the analysis from Python to R and provided a detailed script for better understanding and reproducibility.

## Folder Structure

```

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is `house_price_subset.csv`, which is placed in the `data` directory. You can find the dataset on the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhibhojani/house-price).

## Reference Script
The main python script which we used to reproduce these results can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sainitishmitta04/house-price-data-cleaning-eda-ml-models)

## Scripts
The main R script for this analysis is located in the `scripts` directory. You can find the detailed analysis script [here](RR_House_Price.qmd).

## Output
The output of the analysis, including visualizations and model evaluations, is compiled into the html document.

## Presentation
For presenting our work, we have created a HTML file which can be found in the `RR_House_price.html` file. This file includes detailed explanations of each step in the analysis process.


## Conclusion
We have implemented various machine learning models to predict house prices. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance in predicting house prices. Future improvements could include further hyperparameter tuning and exploring other advanced models.

Thank you for reviewing our project. We look forward to your feedback.
